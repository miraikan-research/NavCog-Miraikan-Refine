## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The developer need to add a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below. You can add either -s or --signoff to your usual git commit commands. If Signed-off-by is attached to the commit message, it is regarded as agreed to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1.

**Source Code Heading**

Before modifying NavCogMiraikan app, please create a **IDETemplateMacros.plist** file under either of directories below:
- **Project user data**: NavCog3.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/[username].xcuserdatad/IDETemplateMacros.plist. - using that location would cover a specific project for just a single developer.
- **Project shared data**: NavCog3.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist- using that location would cover a specific project for the whole team using the workspace.
- **Workspace user data**: NavCog3.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/[username].xcuserdatad/IDETemplateMacros.plist.- using that location would cover all projects in the workspace for just a single developer.
- **Workspace shared data**: NavCog3.xcworkspace/xcshareddata/IDETemplateMacros.plist. - using that location would cover all projects in the workspace for the whole team using the workspace.
- **User Xcode data**: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/IDETemplateMacros.plist - for all projects edited by the local user.
